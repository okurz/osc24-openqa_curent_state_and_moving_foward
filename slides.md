## Scope
* Who we are
* current state
* moving forward
* collaborate and contribute

Note:
openQA is one of the key elements that ensures the delivery of updates and new
versions of operating systems, it is the heart of openSUSE's effort to deliver
stable systems for our users, and SUSE's quality gate, used to ensure that
updates and new releases of the operating systems aren't breaking operations
of customers; however it is growing outside openSUSE, Fedora and SUSE,
expanding to other distributions, so we need to start thinking how to
collaborate further, and have a clearer picture for users of openQA's
ecosystem and integration capabilities.

Santiago Zarate is the Product Owner of Quality Engineering Core team at SUSE,
they collaborate closely with the Quality Engineering Tools Team and rest of
the teams of the Quality Engineering department

Note:
wants to provide a window
into how to close the gap between users outside of openSUSE/SUSE and the
openQA development team

## Points to take away

* openQA is actively used and developed
